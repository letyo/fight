This was my first "bigger" project. I just wanted to try out the things, what I've learned, and put them together.

This is written in JavaScript and used Ajax to read out the datas of the monsters from a MySQL database.

It's a very simple game: You have an opponent, and when you click on the Attack button, then you and your opponent try to hit each other. Then the game writes out, whether your/him attack was successful or not, and how many hit points did you/he lose, if it was successful. And so on, until one of you will be dead.

I intend to extend it later.
